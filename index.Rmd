Edit these lines as appropriate.
The actual thesis content is in several Rmd files.

You'll need to edit the _bookdown.yml file to set the order in which you'd like them to appear. 

If you have specific LaTeX packages to add, put them in aucklandthesis.tex.

You will need to ensure you have installed the knitr and bookdown packages for R.

You will also need LaTeX installed on your computer.
